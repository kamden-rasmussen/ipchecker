# IPChecker

IPChecker is a simple Go application that periodically checks your public IP address and can send you an email when it changes. This can be useful if you need to remotely access your home network and your ISP assigns you a dynamic IP address. Used for Dynamic Domain Name Service (DDNS) purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running IPChecker, you need to have the following:

1. A stationary system that can run Go applications
2. Docker installed on the system

If you want to use SendGrid, you will also need the following

1. A working email account that can send and receive emails
2. A SendGrid account and API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Install the dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    go mod download
    ```

3. Set the necessary environment variables by creating a .env file at the root of the project directory. The following variables are required:

    ```bash
    CURRENT_IP #SET THIS TO 11.111.111.111
    ```

4. Build the application using the following command:

    ```bash
    make build
    make run
    ```
